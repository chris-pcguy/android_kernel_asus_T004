Only tested on an A86/T004 A86_ER1/0x5 with a literally broken digitizer, together with a T003P station.

WIP! There's not much working yet except for the recovery image and the kernel.

Caveat emptor!

A Frankenstein's monster-like merge between "ASUS_A86-12.4.0.66-kernel-src.tar" and "https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_cyanogen_msm8974/"

"Joke of a ChangeLog":

"CONFIG_ARM_ARCH_TIMER_VCT_ACCESS=y" to avoid "invalid instruction" error.
original "/arch/arm/include/asm/elf.h" to avoid sigkill error.
"/drivers/staging/android/lowmemorykiller.c" hasn't been merged, but replaced by the file in the GitHub repo. I may/might merge it sooner or later. (English is hard)
Some ASUS drivers are using the new alarmtimer-interface now to avoid a kernel crash.
Fix "no sound" by renaming some DeviceTree sections. (Thus syncing it with the merged kernel source)
"Carefully" merged some DeviceTree parts. Also merged '"AIF4 VI", "MCLK",' a long time ago for a reason I don't know anymore.
Workaround: Use the original "/drivers/video/msm/mdss/mdss_hdmi_tx.[ch]" files. (switching pad/phone)
kernel/printk: Show correct caller process.
Adding kernel config "CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_32BIT=n", "CONFIG_ENABLE_DEFAULT_TRACERS=y", "CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER=y", "CONFIG_SECCOMP=y", "CONFIG_PROC_DEVICETREE=y" and replace "CONFIG_NF_NAT" with "CONFIG_NF_NAT_IPV[46]".
Adding patch "lineageos_A86_vendor_boringssl_1.patch" for OpenGL_adreno and DRM libraries.
Added manifest, overlays and various configs. I'm unsure if the values in them are even remotely correct.
Boot from MicroSD instead to avoid premature eMMC death. Might get reverted when this port is mature enough.
Some firmware files from the modem partition are invalid, use those from the original system partition instead (e.g. adsp)
WiFi "should" work now (untested), but Bluetooth, USB OTG, Camera, Radio and Pad probably won't.

Caveats:
There's a vague possibility that the kernel could crash or the displays could stop to respond if you (re)plug the pad. Race condition?
Prop "sys.usb.ffs.aio_compat=1" needs to be set to run adbd.
LineageOS' build system is adding "ro.adb.secure=1" to a (-userdebug) recovery image for some reason. Use "-eng" instead.
Sound output via audio jack doesn't work with cmdline flag "dbg=y".
If your USB (OTG) device won't work, just try to replug the OTG adapter at the phone's jack.

Issues:
The kernel might crash or the USB socket might stop working because of USB issues. xhci issues, race condition? ("Timeout while waiting for address device command"?)
Switching pad/phone: The actual fix seemed to be the first two lines of the ChangeLog, but it's more on/off. It looks like a race condition. (former changelog entry: parts of original "/drivers/video/msm/mdss/mdss_hdmi_tx.[ch]" to avoid errors while switching pad/phone)

To do:
Carefully merging DeviceTree sections.
Maybe merging the cpufreq_stats-patches from LineageOS/android_kernel_htc_msm8952?
Merging it with 'LineageOS/android_kernel_fairphone_msm8974/'?

---

Is there any official MSM8974 upstream where I could sync from?
Is there a way to enable audbg? The cmdline-flag, setprop-flag and providing 3.3V to the microphone pin doesn't seem to work.
